# Welcome to the Website for the Eastchester District Key Club. 

The Eastchester District Key Club is a student-led service organization that focuses on helping others and spreading awareness of the issues prevalent outside our welcoming community.

In accordance with our motto, **“Caring - Our Way of Life”**, our members dedicate themselves to improving Eastchester through their support of various causes, both small and large. <br> <br> We organize fundraisers that occur year-round, advocate for causes that need to be addressed, and offer all our members a chance to participate in such community service endeavors. Through the experiences we gain from volunteering, fundraising, and advocating, our members develop leadership skills that later make a difference in the world. <br> <br>Not only do we build the best possible leaders, but we also build the best possible people.
